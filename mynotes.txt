How to figure out what catalyst goes in what slot
1. Search for the "Rat King Catalyst" InventoryItem (https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:1758592809)
2. Search "deep:1758592809" to find the SocketType associated with the catalyst
3. The hash should show up in the SocketType under PlugWhitelist[x].reinitializationPossiblePlugHashes[0] = 1758592809 (https://data.destinysets.com/i/SocketType:3812783610)
4. Take that SocketType hash and search "deep:3812783610". That should surface the Rat King InventoryItem
5. Search the Rat King InventoryItem where sockets.socketEntries[x].socketTypeHash = 3812783610 (https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2362471601)
6. Note that the "singleInitialItemHash" (2673643645) references the empty catalyst socket InventoryItem (https://data.destinysets.com/i/InventoryItem:2362471601/InventoryItem:2673643645)
